## Comprehension Check
Can you answer the following questions:
1. What is agile software development? 
Making small incremental changes & starting with MVP. 
2. What is an MVP? 
Minimum Viable Product. 
3. If you pull down a teammate's branch and you have merge conflicts, how do you handle it? 
You can assign someone to review the code directly on github or on your favorite editor (e.g. VS Code either allows you to accept or reject incoming changes from the merge).


## Learning Objectives

* Speak technically about a feature we implemented in our project
* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project
* Resolve merge conflicts
